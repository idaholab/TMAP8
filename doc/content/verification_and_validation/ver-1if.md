# Species Equilibration Problem in Lawdep Conditions with Unequal Starting Pressures

!alert tip title=TMAP8 supports different surface reaction models
The current case uses what TMAP7 called the `lawdep` model.
The [theory_manual.md] page describes the `lawdep` model and other surface models.

## General Case Description

This verification problem is taken from [!cite](ambrosek2008verification) and builds on [ver-1ie](ver-1ie.md). The configuration and modeling parameters are the same as in [ver-1ie](ver-1ie.md), except that, in the current case, the starting pressures for A$_2$ and B$_2$ are not equal. The case is simulated in [/ver-1ie.i], but the starting pressures of A$_2$ and B$_2$ are $1 \times 10^4$ Pa and $1 \times 10^5$ Pa, respectively, and there is no AB initially present.

## Analytical solution

Similar to [ver-1ie](ver-1ie.md), the governing equation becomes

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lawdep:equation_p_ab_final}
\frac{d P_{AB}}{dt} = \frac{S k_B T K_d}{V} \left(2 \sqrt{P^0_{A_2} - \frac{P_{AB}}{2}} \sqrt{P^0_{B_2} - \frac{P_{AB}}{2}} - P_{AB}\right).
\end{equation}

This is a nonlinear function and the analytical solution is hard to calculate. [!cite](ambrosek2008verification) uses the solution from [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md) with a different saturation time constant to compare with the numerical solution. The equation is defined by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lawdep:analytical_solution}
P_{AB}  = \frac{2 P_{A_2}^0 P_{B_2}^0}{P_{A_2}^0 + P_{B_2}^0} \left(1 - \exp \left(- \frac{t}{\tau}\right)\right),
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the saturation time constant. $\tau$ is selected as 0.123 to match the numerical solution in [eq:lawdep:analytical_solution].

!alert note title= No exact analytical solution
Because [eq:lawdep:equation_p_ab_final] is a complex nonlinear function, we have no exact analytical solution to compare against. This case is therefore not truly a verification case. However, we compare the numerical solution provided by TMAP8 against an adapted analytical solution from [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md) and we benchmark the TMAP8 predictions against the TMAP7 results from [!cite](ambrosek2008verification).


## Results

A comparison of the AB concentration as a function of time is plotted in [ver-1if_comparison_pressure]. The TMAP8 calculations are found to be in reasonable agreement with the solution from TMAP7, with a root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) of RMSPE =  13.56%. It makes sense for us because the solution from TMAP7 is not the real analytical solution. Also, the results from TMAP8 represent an improvement from those from TMAP7, which showed some numerical instability around $t=2.5$ s. The concentrations of A$_2$ and B$_2$ as a function of time are also plotted in [ver-1if_comparison_pressure].

## Input files

!style halign=left
The input file for this case can be obtained by updating the initial pressure for B$_2$ in [/ver-1ie.i], which is the approach used to create tests in TMAP8 at [/ver-1if/tests].

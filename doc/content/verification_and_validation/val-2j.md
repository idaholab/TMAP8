# Tritium Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy from Li$_2$TiO$_3$ Solid Breeder

## Case Description

This validation case models tritium thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) from neutron-irradiated Li$_2$TiO$_3$ (lithium titanate) crystalline grains, a candidate solid tritium breeding material for Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) fusion reactors. The experimental data and model are from [!cite](kobayashi2015developing).

Li$_2$TiO$_3$ samples were irradiated at the Kyoto University Reactor (KUR) at various neutron fluences. After irradiation, the tritium release behavior was measured by TDS with a heating rate of 5 K/min starting from 300 K using pure helium as the purge gas. The average grain radius was 1.5 $\mu$m.

Sample E (high defect density, $D_{id}$ = $3.384 \times 10^{26}$ m$^{-3}$, corresponding to 0.018 defect/Li$_2$TiO$_3$) is modeled, where tritium release is significantly influenced by trapping at O$^{-}$-centers and defect annihilation.

## Model Description

### Diffusion of Mobile Species

TMAP8 simulates tritium diffusion and trapping in a single spherical grain of Li$_2$TiO$_3$ using 1D spherical coordinates (`coord_type = RSPHERICAL`). The governing equation for mobile tritium concentration $C$ is [!citep](kobayashi2015developing):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:diffusion_trapping}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \left( \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial r^2} + \frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial C}{\partial r} \right) - \frac{\partial C_T}{\partial t},
\end{equation}

where $C_T$ is the concentration of trapped tritium in O$^{-}$-centers, $D$ is the temperature-dependent diffusivity following the Arrhenius law:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:diffusivity}
D = D_0 \exp \left( -\frac{E_d}{k_B T} \right),
\end{equation}

where $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_d$ is the activation energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

### Trapping and Detrapping

Only O$^{-}$-center (hydroxyl group) trapping is included in this model. As noted by [!cite](kobayashi2015developing) (p. 26), tritium release controlled by detrapping from F$^+$-centers (oxygen vacancies) occurs near 580 K, which corresponds to the release temperature controlled by the diffusion process itself. Because F$^+$-center detrapping is not rate-limiting relative to diffusion, it does not produce a distinct feature (i.e., peak) in the TDS spectrum, and is therefore excluded from the model.

The trapped concentration $C_T$ evolves according to:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:trapping}
\frac{\partial C_T}{\partial t} = \alpha_t \frac{C_T^{\text{empty}} C_M}{N} - \alpha_r C_T,
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the lattice site density, and $C_T^{\text{empty}} = \chi N - C_T$ is the empty trap concentration with $\chi$ being the trap site fraction.

The trapping and detrapping rate coefficients follow Arrhenius relationships:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:trapping_rate}
\alpha_t = \alpha_{t0} \exp\left(-\frac{\epsilon_t}{k_B T}\right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:detrapping_rate}
\alpha_r = \alpha_{r0} \exp\left(-\frac{\epsilon_r}{k_B T}\right),
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_{t0}$ and $\alpha_{r0}$ are pre-factors of trapping and release rate coefficients, $\epsilon_t$ and $\epsilon_r$ are the trapping and release energies, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

### Defect annihilation

During TDS heating, radiation-induced defect sites undergo first-order annihilation [!citep](kobayashi2015developing):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:annihilation}
\frac{d D_{id}}{dt} = -k_{dp-da} \, D_{id},
\end{equation}

where $D_{id}$ is the defect density. The trap site fraction $\chi$ is related to radiation defect density $D_{id}$. However, the exact relationship is not clearly indicated in [!citep](kobayashi2015developing). Therefore, the initial trap site density is assumed to equal the defect density with $\chi(0)N = D_{id}$.

The annihilation rate coefficient, $k_{dp-da}$, is described as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:annihilation_rate}
k_{dp-da} = k_{dp-da,0} \exp \left( -\frac{E_{dp-da}}{k_B T} \right).
\end{equation}

The raising temperature reduces the available trap sites: the trap site fraction $\chi$ decays over time following [eq:annihilation], preventing re-trapping into annihilated sites. This is implemented by solving the annihilation equation self-consistently as an additional variable within the simulation, using a `ReleasingNodalKernel`.

### Boundary and initial conditions

- $\partial C / \partial r = 0$ at $r = 0$ (symmetry at grain center)
- $C = 0$ at $r = r_g$ (fast surface release, [!cite](kobayashi2015developing))

The mobile and trapped tritium concentrations are initialized at their local trapping/detrapping equilibrium values at the starting temperature $T_{\text{start}}$ = 300 K. The equilibrium mobile concentration is computed from the balance of trapping and detrapping rates. This avoids an initial transient from any imbalance between trapping and detrapping.
Since the TDS output is normalized to arbitrary units, only the shape of the release curve matters, not the absolute concentrations.

## Results

### Results before optimization

[val-2j_comparison_e] shows the comparison between TMAP8 and the experimental TDS spectrum for Sample E (high defect density). The O$^{-}$-center trapping model with defect annihilation captures the broad release profile. The high detrapping energy of O$^{-}$-centers (1.19 eV) produces a release peak above 650 K that is distinct from the diffusion-controlled release. The defect annihilation mechanism reduces the effective trap density at high temperatures, suppressing re-trapping and allowing tritium to escape more efficiently.

### Results after optimization

The agreement between the TMAP8 simulation and experimental data can be improved by optimizing the model parameters using [MOOSE's stochastic tools module](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/stochastic_tools/index.html). A Bayesian optimization approach [!citep](DHULIPALA2026102776) was applied to optimize six key parameters (i.e., three Arrhenius pre-exponential factors (in log$_{10}$ space) and three activation energies) to better match the experimental TDS curve for Sample E. 
The defect annihilation parameters were not included in the optimization because annihilation parameter has only a minor impact on the tritium release during TDS. 
As shown in [val-2j_defect_density_evolution], the normalized defect density remains close to unity throughout the main release region (below ~750 K) and only decreases significantly at higher temperatures where the tritium release flux is decreasing. 
The optimization used Gaussian Process active learning with Expected Improvement acquisition, running 40 iterations with 5 parallel proposals per iteration.

The objective function evaluates the RMSPE between the simulated and experimental normalized release rates using a continuous comparison at every simulation timestep. The experimental TDS curve is represented as a piecewise-linear interpolation function, and the RMSPE is accumulated over the full temperature ramp. Low-temperature constraint points (300--475 K) with a small target value penalize parameter sets that produce spurious early release peaks.

[val-2j_bayesian_parameter_exploration] compares the reference parameter values from [!cite](kobayashi2015developing) (blue dashed lines) with the Bayesian-optimized values (red solid lines) for each of the six fitted parameters. The green curves show the distribution of the parameters with top 20% RMSPE evaluations from the Bayesian optimization, providing insight into which parameter regions produce good fits to the experimental data. The gray shaded region indicates the search range used during optimization. The optimized values fall within the high-density regions of the distributions, confirming consistency with the near-optimal parameter space.

[val-2j_arrhenius_comparison] compares the Arrhenius-law temperature dependence of the diffusivity $D(T)$, trapping rate coefficient $\alpha_t(T)$, and detrapping rate coefficient $\alpha_r(T)$ between the reference and optimized parameter sets over the 300--900 K TDS temperature range. The diffusivity pre-exponential increases by roughly two orders of magnitude while the activation energy decreases modestly (1.07 to 0.97 eV). The trapping prefactor increases by about one order of magnitude with a reduced activation energy, while the detrapping parameters shift more modestly.

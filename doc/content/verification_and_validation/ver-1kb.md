# Henry’s Law Boundaries with No Volumetric Source

## General Case Description

Two enclosures are separated by a membrane that allows diffusion according to Henry’s law, with no volumetric source present. Enclosure 2 has twice the volume of Enclosure 1.

## Case Set Up

This verification problem is taken from [!cite](ambrosek2008verification).

This setup describes a diffusion system in which tritium T$_2$ is modeled across a one-dimensional domain split into two enclosures. The total length of this domain is defined by the number of segments (20 segments) and the node size of $1.25 \times 10^{-5}$ m, yielding a total system length of $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ m. The system operates at a constant temperature of 500 Kelvin. Initial tritium pressures are specified as $10^{5}$ Pa for Enclosure 1 and $10^{-10}$ Pa for Enclosure 2.

Over time, the pressures of T$_2$, which diffuses across the membrane in accordance with Henry’s law, will gradually equilibrate between the two enclosures.

The diffusion process in each of the two enclosures can be described by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_1}{\partial t} = \nabla D \nabla C_1,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_2}{\partial t} = \nabla D \nabla C_2,
\end{equation}

where $C_1$ and $C_2$ represent the concentration fields in enclosures 1 and 2 respectively, and $D$ denotes the diffusivity.

The concentration in Enclosure 1 is related to the partial pressure and concentration in Enclosure 2 via the interface sorption law:

\begin{equation}
C_1 = K P_2^n = K \left( C_2 RT \right)^n
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the ideal gas constant in J/mol/K, $T$ is the temperature in K, $K$ is the solubility, and $n$ is the exponent of the sorption law. For Henry’s law, $n=1$.

## Results

Two subcases are considered. In the first subcase, we assume that $K=1/RT$ as is done in [!cite](ambrosek2008verification), which is expected to lead to $C_1 = C_2$ at equilibrium. In the second, $K=10/RT$, which is expected to lead to $C_1 = 10 C_2$. This second case is added to exercise TMAP8 in a case with a concentration jump.
In the first subcase, consistent with the results from TMAP7, the pressure evolution in both enclosures is shown in [ver-1kb_comparison_time] as a function of time. Both pressures find equilibrium and become equal, which is consistent with $C_1 = K RT C_2^n$ for $K=1/RT$ and $n=1$. The concentration ratio between enclosures 1 and 2 in [ver-1kb_concentration_ratio] shows that the results obtained with TMAP8 are consistent with the analytical results derived from the sorption law for $K R T=1$. As shown in [ver-1kb_mass_conservation], mass is conserved between the two enclosures over time, with a variation in mass of only $2 \times 10^{-6}$ %.

In the second subcase, the sorption law with $K=10/RT$ does not lead to equal pressure in both enclosure. As illustrated in [ver-1kb_comparison_time_k10], the pressure jump maintains a ratio of $C_1/C_2 \approx 10$, which is consistent with the relationship $C_1 = K RT C_2^n$ for $K=10/RT$ and $n=1$. The concentration ratio between enclosures 1 and 2 in [ver-1kb_concentration_ratio_k10] shows that the results obtained with TMAP8 are consistent with the analytical results derived from the sorption law for $K RT=10$. Additionally, [ver-1kb_mass_conservation_k10] verifies that mass is conserved between the two enclosures over time, with a variation in mass of only $8 \cdot 10^{—7}$ \%.

!alert note title=A Comparison with TMAP7 Results: Impact of Diffusivity Variations on Kinetics
The kinetics observed in our results differ from those presented in TMAP7. We attribute this discrepancy to a variation in the diffusivity value used, which significantly affects the diffusion rate.

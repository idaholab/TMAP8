# Joule Heating in a Slab under Applied Voltage

## Case Description

This verification case isolates the temperature response caused by Joule heating in a one-dimensional proton-conducting ceramic (PCC) slab under an applied voltage. In PCC membranes, the electrical current induced by an applied voltage generates Joule heating, which can increase the local temperature and influence hydrogen-isotope transport. This case verifies the thermal part of the voltage-assisted PCC model independently against an analytical solution for a slab with a uniform volumetric heat source.

This verification case uses a 5 mm half-domain that represents one half of the original 10 mm membrane. The left boundary is held at a prescribed wall temperature, and the right boundary is adiabatic to represent the symmetry plane at the slab centerline. The same electric field as the original full-domain configuration is retained by using a 20 V drop across the full 10 mm membrane.

## Case Set Up

The heat equation with a Joule heating source is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ver-1o_heat}
\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
= \nabla \cdot \left(\kappa \nabla T\right) + \dot{q}_J,
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity, $T$ is the temperature, $t$ is the time, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, and $\dot{q}_J$ is the volumetric Joule heating rate. The Joule heating is computed from a constant electrical conductivity and a constant applied electric field,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ver-1o_joule}
\dot{q}_J = \sigma E^2 = \sigma \left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{full}}}{L_{\mathrm{full}}}\right)^2,
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, $E$ is the magnitude of the applied electric field, $V_{\mathrm{full}}$ is the voltage drop across the full slab, and $L_{\mathrm{full}}$ is the full slab thickness. The half-domain solved in TMAP8 has thickness $L = L_{\mathrm{full}}/2$, with boundary conditions

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ver-1o_bcs}
T = T_{\mathrm{wall}} \quad \mathrm{on}\ \Gamma_{\mathrm{wall}},
\qquad
\nabla T \cdot \mathbf{n} = 0 \quad \mathrm{on}\ \Gamma_{\mathrm{sym}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector pointing perpendicular to the boundary surface.

The imposed electric potential is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ver-1o_voltage_profile}
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = V_{\mathrm{left}} - \mathbf{E} \cdot \left(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{left}}\right),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{E}$ is the constant applied electric-field vector and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{left}}$ is a point on the prescribed-voltage boundary. In this one-dimensional verification case, this reduces to $\phi(x) = V_{\mathrm{left}} - (V_{\mathrm{full}}/L_{\mathrm{full}})x$. Because the conductivity and electric field are both constant, $\dot{q}_J$ is uniform in space.

The model parameters used in this case are listed in [ver-1o_set_up_values]. The thermal properties of the BCY20 membrane are taken from [!cite](yamanaka2003thermophysical). The remaining parameters are selected to simplify the verification problem. The electrical conductivity is set to a constant reference value, and the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ is deliberately set lower than the physical BCY20 value to produce a meaningful temperature rise for verification purposes.

The verification focuses on two aspects of the thermal solution: (1) the transient maximum temperature rise at the insulated symmetry plane, and (2) the transient spatial temperature profile at selected times.

## Analytical Solution

[!cite](miller1967transient) provides the analytical solution for the transient temperature solution under a constant volumetric heat source as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ver1o_transient}
T(x,t) = T_{\mathrm{wall}} + \frac{\dot{q}_J \ell^2}{\kappa}
\left[
  \frac{x}{\ell} - \frac{1}{2}\!\left(\frac{x}{\ell}\right)^{\!2}
  - 2 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
    \frac{\sin\!\left(\lambda_n x/\ell\right)}{\lambda_n^3}
    \exp\!\left(-\lambda_n^2 \frac{\alpha t}{\ell^2}\right)
\right],
\end{equation}

where $\alpha = \kappa/(\rho c_p)$ is the thermal diffusivity, and the eigenvalues $\lambda_n$ are described as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ver1o_lambda}
\lambda_n = \left(n + \tfrac{1}{2}\right)\pi, \qquad n = 0,\, 1,\, 2,\, \ldots,
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the integer mode number in the Fourier series. As $t \to \infty$, \cref{eq:ver1o_transient} reduces to the steady-state parabolic profile

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ver1o_ss}
T(x) = T_{\mathrm{wall}} + \frac{\dot{q}_J}{\kappa}\!\left(\ell x - \frac{x^2}{2}\right).
\end{equation}


## Results

[ver-1o_comparison_temperature_history] compares the maximum temperature rise history, $\Delta T_{\max}(t)$, predicted by TMAP8 against the analytical solution evaluated at the insulated face $x = L$. The TMAP8 result closely matches the analytical solution, with a root mean square error (RMSPE) of 0.50%.

# TMAP8 SpeciesTrapping Physics syntax

The `[Physics/SpeciesTrapping]` block is used as an intermediate syntax level. It currently
does not taken any parameters, but nested blocks can be specified. The following
`Physics` syntax are nested within this level:

- [Ordinary Differential Equation for species trapping at a point](Physics/SpeciesTrapping/ODE/index.md)
- [Continuous Galerkin for species trapping in a multi-dimensional field](Physics/SpeciesTrapping/ContinuousGalerkin/index.md)

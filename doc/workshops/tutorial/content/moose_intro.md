# The Finite Element Method in MOOSE

MOOSE solves PDEs using the Galerkin finite element method (the finite volume method is also available for fluid flow).

+Key steps:+

1. Write strong form of PDE
2. Convert to weak form (multiply by test function, integrate by parts)
3. Discretize with shape functions
4. Form residual vector and Jacobian matrix
5. Solve nonlinear system with Newton's method

+MOOSE handles:+

- Mesh management
- Shape functions
- Quadrature rules
- Assembly process
- Parallel decomposition

!---

# Example: Strong form, weak form, and implementation

# Kernels System: Building PDEs

!row!
!col! width=60%

```cpp
class DiffusionKernel : public ADKernel
{
protected:
  virtual ADReal computeQpResidual() override
  {
    return _grad_test[_i][_qp] * _grad_u[_qp];
  }
};
```

!col-end!

!col! width=40%

- Kernels represent volume terms in PDEs
- Each kernel computes one term
- Automatic differentiation for Jacobians
- Mix kernels to build complex equations

!col-end!
!row-end!

+Available variables:+

- `_u`, `_grad_u`: Variable value and gradient
- `_test`, `_grad_test`: Test function value and gradient
- `_qp`: Quadrature point index
- `_q_point`: Physical coordinates

!---

# Special Note: NodalKernels System


+Purpose+: Compute residual contributions at nodes rather than quadrature points

!row!
!col! width=50%

+When to Use NodalKernels:+

- Non-diffusive species
- ODEs or time-derivative only terms
- Point sources or sinks
- Reaction terms without spatial derivatives
- Lumped parameter models

!col-end!

!col! width=5%
!! intentionally empty column to produce whitespace separation between listing snippet that goes out-of-box and the right-hand column
!col-end!

!col! width=50%

+Key Differences from Kernels:+

- Operates on nodes, not elements
- No spatial gradients available
- `_qp = 0` always (single evaluation point)
- No test function needed in residual
- More efficient for non-spatial terms

!col-end!
!row-end!

!row!
!col! width=50%

+Implementation:+

```cpp
  ADReal
  ReactionNodalKernel::computeQpResidual()
  {
    // Note: _qp = 0 for nodal kernels
    // (evaluated at only a single point)
    return _coef * _u[_qp];
  }
};
```

!col-end!

!col! width=5%
!! intentionally empty column to produce whitespace separation between listing snippet that goes out-of-box and the right-hand column
!col-end!

!col! width=50%

+Input File Example:+

```
[NodalKernels]
  ...
  [decay]
    type = ReactionNodalKernel
    variable = C_tritium
    coef = 1.0
  []
[]
```

!col-end!
!row-end!

# NodalKernels in TMAP8

Nodal kernels are used to model non-diffusive species. In the case of TMAP8, nodal kernels are key to modeling trapped species. For example, these are used in the [Ver-1d verification case](ver-1d.md) and several validation cases.

+Application Examples:+

- Trap filling/release (Ver-1d)
- Surface reactions at nodes

!---

# Materials System: Property Management

!row!
!col! width=60%

+Producer/Consumer Pattern:+

- Materials produce properties than can be used in the rest of the simulation
- Other objects (including other materials), can consume properties
- Properties can vary in space and time
- Properties can be functions of variables or other properties

!col-end!

!col! width=2%
!! test
!col-end!

!col! width=38%

```cpp
// Material object, in the constructor
_permeability(declareADProperty<Real>("permeability"))
// In the compute method
_permeability = 2.0;

// Consumer object (Kernel, BCs, etc.) in the constructor
_permeability(getADMaterialProperty<Real>("permeability"))

// In the "computeQp..." method
ADReal
SomeObject::computeQpResidual() {
return _permability[_qp] * _grad_u[_qp] * _grad_test[_qp];
}
```

!col-end!
!row-end!

+Key Methods:+

- `declareProperty<Type>()` - produce a standard material property in a material object
- `getMaterialProperty<Type>()` - consume a standard material property in a MOOSE object
- `declareProperty<Type>()` - produce an AD material property in a material object
- `getADMaterialProperty<Type>()` - consume an AD material property in a MOOSE object

!row!
!col! width=45%

+Mathematical Forms:+

- +Dirichlet+: $u = g$ on $\Gamma$
- +Neumann+: $\nabla u \cdot n = h$ on $\Gamma$
- +Robin (Mixed)+: $\alpha u + \beta \nabla u \cdot n = \gamma$ on $\Gamma$

+Base Classes:+

- `NodalBC`: Applied at nodes (Dirichlet)
- `IntegratedBC`: Applied over sides (Neumann/Robin)
- AD versions for automatic differentiation

!col-end!

!col! width=50%

+Common BCs in MOOSE/TMAP8:+

- `DirichletBC`: Fixed value

# InterfaceKernel System

+Purpose+: Couple physics across internal interfaces between subdomains

!row!
!col! width=47%

+Key Concepts:+

- Operates on internal subdomain boundaries

!col-end!

!col! width=50%

+Applications:+

# TMAP8 Example: InterfaceSorption

!row!
!col! width=48%

Computes a sorption law at the interface between solid and gas in isothermal conditions.

!equation
C_s = K P^n = K(C_g RT)^n

where:

- $R$ = ideal gas constant (J/mol/K)
- $T$ = temperature (K)
- $K$ = solubility (units depend on $C_s$ and $P$)

!equation
K = K_0 \exp \left(\frac{-E_a}{RT}\right)

- $K_0$ = pre-exponential constant
- $E_a$ = activation energy (J/mol)
- $n$ = sorption law exponent (1 = Henry's, 1/2 = Sievert's)

# Auxiliary System: Arbitrarily Calculated Variables

- +Purpose+: Variables that are not solved for as part of a PDE/ODE.
- +Use cases+: Postprocessing, visualization, coupling

!row!
!col! width=50%

+Auxiliary Variables:+

- Not solved for directly
- Can be computed from other variables
- Can be computed directly or imposed

  - Example: temperature/pressure with a set history)

- Can be nodal or elemental

!col-end!

!col! width=50%

+Example: Flux Vector from Concentration+

!equation
\vec{J} = -D \nabla C

- Concentration ($C$) is a nonlinear variable, computed by the solver.
- Diffusive flux ($\vec{J}$) is an auxiliary variable.
- Expression is computed via AuxKernel ([DiffusionFluxAux](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/TMAP8/source/auxkernels/DiffusionFluxAux.html))

!col-end!
!row-end!

!---

# Another Aux Example: Temperature

This is sampled from the [val-2b validation case](val-2b.md). First, we need to declare the `temperature` variable, as we would any other variable. Except, we do it here under the `AuxVariables` block. Then, we set up an `AuxKernel` to calculate it using a time-dependent function.

!listing val-2b.i block=AuxVariables/temperature

!listing val-2b.i block=AuxKernels/temperature_aux

!---

# Example, cont.: Aux Temperature in a BC

Now, `temperature` can be used wherever a regular `MooseVariable` is used. For example, we use it in [val-2b](val-2b.md) in an [EquilibriumBC](EquilibriumBC.md) boundary condition on the `left` boundary.

!listing val-2b.i block=BCs/left_flux

# Inline Unit Conversions in Input Files

+Built-in parser enables calculations and unit conversions directly in input files using the MOOSE `fparse` and `units` systems.+

```
${fparse num1 * num2}  # On-the-fly calculations

${units num1 unit1 -> unit2}  # Unit conversions

param = 5.0 * ${top_level_coef1} + ${top_level_coef2}  # Replacements
```

!row!
!col! width=50%

+Available Functions in `fparse`:+

- Basic: `+ - * / ^`
- Trig: `sin cos tan`
- Exp/Log: `exp log log10`
- Other: `sqrt abs min max`
- Constants: `pi` (3.14159...)

!col-end!

!col! width=50%

+Advantages:+

- Self-documenting calculations
- Avoid external calculators
- Useful when performing parametric studies
- Version control friendly

!col-end!
!row-end!

# Fparse / Units Conversion Usage Example

+At the input file top level:+

!listing val-2d.i start=Diffusion parameters end=Traps parameters

+In an object:+

!listing val-2d.i block=Postprocessors/scaled_flux_surface_right

!---

# Solver System: PJFNK Method

+Preconditioned Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (PJFNK)+

!row!
!col! width=50%

+Newton's Method:+

- Solves nonlinear system: $R(u) = 0$
- Update: $u^{n+1} = u^n - J^{-1}R$
- Quadratic convergence

+Jacobian-Free:+

- Approximate $J(u) P^{-1} v$ operation via finite differences
- No explicit Jacobian formation
- Reduces memory requirements

!col-end!

!col! width=50%

+Krylov Solvers:+

- GMRES (default)
- Conjuate Gradient (CG), BiCGStab
- Build Krylov subspace

+Preconditioning:+

- Hypre/BoomerAMG
- Block Jacobi
- ILU/LU
- Essential for performance

!col-end!
!row-end!

+Note that a standard Newton solve (using the exact Jacobian) with preconditioning is also available!+

!---

# Automatic Differentiation in MOOSE

!row!
!col! width=45%

+Benefits:+

- No manual Jacobian calculations
- Reduces development time
- Eliminates Jacobian bugs
- Maintains accuracy

```cpp
// Traditional approach
Real computeQpResidual() {...}
Real computeQpJacobian() {...}
Real computeQpOffDiagJacobian() {...}

// AD approach - Jacobian automatic!
ADReal computeQpResidual() {...}
```

!col-end!

!col! width=5%
!! intentionally empty column to produce whitespace separation between listing snippet that goes out-of-box and the right-hand column
!col-end!

!col! width=40%

+How it works:+

- Based on the chain rule of partial derivatives
- Operator overloading (derivatives propagated with `+`,`-`,`*`, etc.)
- "Forward mode" AD
- Uses MetaPhysicL library (from the libMesh team)

+Best practice:+

- Use AD kernels/materials
- Let MOOSE handle derivatives
- +More overhead with this method, but *much* easier to develop!+

- 1D mesh with 200 elements and a maximum length of 1 m.

  - `nx_num` is defined as 200 at the top of the file, and `${}` syntax is used to utilize it elsewhere.
  - `xmin` in a `Mesh` object generally defaults to 0.

- Single variable `mobile` for the mobile species concentration
- Starts with zero initial concentration (not giving an `ICs` block and not setting `initial_condition` in this sub-block defaults to zero).

- A constant source of `value = 1` is placed at left (upstream), due to normalizing the concentration (`cl = 3.1622e18` atoms/$m^3$).

  - Note the use of the `fparse` system to perform this simple calculation.
  - In this case, the action of calculating the source is simple, but use of the parsing system can, in general, enhance readability of the input file.

- A concentration of zero is set at right (downstream).

- Here, postprocessors are used to calculate two quantities:

  - The raw outward flux average on the downstream boundary using the [SideDiffusiveFluxAverage.md] object, given the `diffusivity` from the top of the input.
  - The raw outward flux average is then scaled to its actual value using the [ScalePostprocessor.md], which takes the `outflux` value and scales it by the concentration `cl`.

- For preconditioning, we have a [SingleMatrixPreconditioner.md] (Single Matrix Preconditioner).

  - SMP builds a preconditioning matrix using user-defined off-diagonal parts of the Jacobian matrix.
  - Use of `full = true` uses *all* of the off-diagonal blocks, but tuning of the preconditioning can allow focus on one or more physics in your system.

- Given the time derivative term, we use a Transient executioner with a Newton solver.
- Other solver parameters - including total simulation time, the timestep, and the minimum timestep allowed - is set using parser syntax.

- Here, we want both [Exodus.md] and [CSV.md] output. By simply setting:

  ```
  exodus = true
  csv = true
  ```

- We also turn on [DOFMapOutput.md], only executing it on the initial timestep (after the matrix is constructed). This provides output information on how the matrix is constructed, which is helpful for complicated models.
- Finally, we turn on a simple performance table in the Console output.

# Case 1: Let's Run It!

If using a cloned and locally-built copy of TMAP8:

```bash
cd test/tests/ver-1dd/
../../../tmap8-opt -i ver-1dd.i
```

If using a Docker container:

```bash
cd /tmap8-workdir/tmap8/ver-1dd
tmap8-opt -i ver-1dd.i
```

The output can then be visualized using ParaView, or by using the `comparison_ver-1dd.py` script with some light modifications (change the location of the data file to the output you just generated).

## What to Look For

- Convergence messages in terminal
- Exodus output files with field data (.e extension)
- CSV files with Postprocessor data

- Breakthrough time: $\tau_b = 0.05$ seconds (both analytical and TMAP8)
- Excellent agreement throughout transient

!---

# Case 2: Single Trap Type (ver-1d)

In this case, we are modeling permeation through a membrane with a constant source in which traps are operative.

Traps correspond to physical places in materials where tritium atoms can get trapped, and therefore slow down transport.
For example, tritium atoms can be trapped in interstitial sites, vacancies, grain boundaries, pores, etc., which can all be included as trapps in the model.
These trapping sites are described with an associated density (which can evolve as a function of space, time, irradiation, etc.) and rates and energies for trapping and release.

In the current casse, we account for one type of trapping sites.
The following case will introduce a total of three trapping types.
TMAP8 can incorporate an arbitrary number of trapping sites.

!---

# Case 2: Single Trap Type (ver-1d)

We solve the following equations:

!row!
!col! width=50%

For mobile species:

!equation
\frac{\partial C_M}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla C_M) - \text{trap\_per\_free} \cdot \frac{\partial C_T}{\partial t}

For trapped species:

!equation
\frac{\partial C_T}{\partial t} = \alpha_t \frac{C_T^{empty} C_M}{N \cdot \text{trap\_per\_free}} - \alpha_r C_T

For empty trapping sites:

!equation
C_T^{empty} = C_{T0} \cdot N - \text{trap\_per\_free} \cdot C_T

!col-end!

!col! width=50%

where:

- $C_M$ and $C_T$ are the concentrations of the mobile and trapped species respectively
- $D$ is the diffusivity of the mobile species
- $\alpha_t$ and $\alpha_r$ are the trapping and release rate coefficients
- $\text{trap\_per\_free}$ is a factor converting the magnitude of $C_T$ to be closer to $C_M$ for better numerical convergence
- $C_{T0}$ is the fraction of host sites that can contribute to trapping
- $C_T^{empty}$ is the concentration of empty trapping sites
- $N$ is the host density.

!col-end!

# Trapping parameter

The breakthrough time may have one of two limiting values depending on whether the trapping is in the effective diffusivity or strong-trapping regimes. A trapping parameter is defined by:

\begin{equation}
    \zeta = \frac{\lambda^2 \nu}{\rho D_0} \exp \left( \frac{E_d - \epsilon}{kT} \right) + \frac{c}{\rho}
\end{equation}

where:

- $\lambda$ = lattice parameter
- $\nu$ = Debye frequency ($\approx$ $10^{13} \; s^{-1}$)
- $\rho$ = trapping site fraction
- $D_0$ = diffusivity pre-exponential
- $E_d$ = diffusion activation energy
- $\epsilon$ = trap energy
- $k$ = Boltzmann's constant
- $T$ = temperature
- $c$ = dissolved gas atom fraction

!---

# Effective Diffusivity Regime

The discriminant for which regime is dominant is the ratio of $\zeta$ to c/$\rho$. If $\zeta$ $\gg$ c/$\rho$, then the effective diffusivity regime applies, and the permeation transient is identical to the standard diffusion transient, with the diffusivity replaced by an effective diffusivity

!equation
D_{eff} = \frac{D}{1 + \frac{1}{\zeta}}

to account for the fact that trapping leads to slower transport.

In this limit, the breakthrough time, defined as the intersection of the steepest tangent to the diffusion transient with the time axis, will be

\begin{equation}
    \tau_{b_e} = \frac{l^2}{2 \; \pi^2 \; D_{eff}}
\end{equation}

where $l$ is the thickness of the slab and D is the diffusivity of the gas through the material.

!---

# Strong-trapping Regime

In the deep-trapping limit, $\zeta$ $\approx$ c/$\rho$, and no permeation occurs until essentially all the traps have been filled. Then the system quickly reaches steady-state. The breakthrough time is given by

\begin{equation}
    \tau_{b_d} = \frac{l^2 \rho}{2 \; C_0 \; D}
\end{equation}

where $C_0$ is the steady dissolved gas concentration at the upstream (x = 0) side.

!---

# Case Description

In this scenario, examine reach regime using two input files:

- +ver-1d-diffusion.i:+ where diffusion is the rate-limiting step
- +ver-1d-trapping.i:+ where trapping is the rate-limiting step.

This is the same domain configuration as in Case 1.

# Case 2: Diffusion Limit Input File - Variables

In this case, we'll be highlighting the main changes from Case 1, where we only had diffusion for a single mobile species.

!listing ver-1d-diffusion.i block=Variables

- Now, we have two species, `trapped` and `mobile`. Similar to Case 1, the `mobile` variable is our primary variable, as we'll plot the downstream flux for comparison to analytical solutions.
- Both use the default initial concentrations of zero, as well as the default FEM families/order.

!---

# A Note on ReferenceResidualProblem

- The [ReferenceResidualProblem.md] MOOSE Problem type is designed to allow custom criteria for convergence for separate, coupled physics by using tagged vectors to designate portions of the system matrix.
- These tags are set in the `[Problem]` block using `reference vector` and `extra_tag_vectors` and then used in the *Kernel blocks (of all types).

- [TrappingNodalKernel.md] is used for:

  !equation
  -\alpha_t  \frac {C_T^{empty} C_M } {(N \cdot \text{trap\_per\_free})}

- Finally, [ReleasingNodalKernel.md] is used for:

  !equation
  C_T^{empty} = C_{T0} \cdot N - \text{trap\_per\_free} \cdot C_T

- AuxKernels are also used (in the case of `scaled_empty` and `trapped_sites`) to calculate the total concentration of trapping sites in the model.

- Must fill traps before significant permeation

# Case 3: Multiple Trap Types (ver-1dc)

## Extended System of Equations

This case is very similar to Case 2, except there are now three different types of traps.

Mobile species with three trap interactions:

!equation
\frac{\partial C_M}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \nabla C_M) - \text{trap\_per\_free} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{\partial C_{T_i}}{\partial t}

!equation
\frac{dC_{T_i}}{dt} = \alpha_t^i  \frac {C_{T_i}^{empty} C_M } {(N \cdot \text{trap\_per\_free})} - \alpha_r^i C_{T_i}

Each trap evolves independently (i = 1, 2, 3). Finally, for the empty trapping sites:

!equation
C_{T_i}^{empty} = (C_{{T_i}0} \cdot N - \text{trap\_per\_free} \cdot C_{T_i}  )

!---

# Case 3: Base Input File Strategy

- This case introduces the "input file include" capability in practice.
- `ver-1dc_base.i` contains the mesh, Problem, Variables, Kernels, NodalKernels, Preconditioning, and Executioner settings for both the standard and MMS input files.
- This is done to enable multiple input files to use the same common elements.
- This modular design:

  - Eases maintainability and repeatability
  - Reduces redundancy and errors
  - Allows for case-specific input files
  - Enables more readable highlight of unique physics

# Case 3: Defining Multiple Traps

Multiple sites can have different properties through the use of separate sets of NodalKernels to represent the unique properties of each trap.

# Case 3: Three Trap Parameters

Three traps that are relatively weak are assumed to be active in the slab. Other parameters are the same as the trap in the effective diffusivity limit in [ver-1d](ver-1d.md).

- Trap Type 1

  - Trapping site fraction: 0.1
  - $\epsilon/k$ = 100 K

- Trap Type 2

  - Trapping site fraction: 0.15
  - $\epsilon/k$ = 500 K

- Trap Type 3

  - Trapping site fraction: 0.2
  - $\epsilon/k$ = 800 K

- Breakthrough time: 4.04 s (analytical) vs 4.12 s (TMAP8)
- Combined effect of all three traps

# Case 3: MMS Verification Approach

A detailed and step by step description of the method of manufacturing solution (MMS) approach is available on the [MOOSE MMS page](mms.md).
The [ver-1dc](ver-1dc.md) documentation page provides more information about how to apply the MMS approach to this case.

The main steps of the MMS approach are:

- select spatial smoothly-varying sinusoidal spatial solutions for the mobile and trapped species.
- input them in the desired equations and derive the forcing functions.
- re-write the equations to include the forcing function and equate 0 with the solutions slected above.
- solve these equations, which have the known solutions selected above that can be compared against the calculated solutions.

2. Change detrapping energy: $\epsilon = 200$
3. Run the simulation
4. Compare breakthrough time with original

## Questions to Consider:

- How does breakthrough time change?
- Which regime are we in now?
- What $\zeta$ value does this correspond to?
